## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Web Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. **Text Editor**: You can use any text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc., to view and edit the files.
3. **Optional**: If you want to deploy the website, you may want to use a web hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a local server for testing.

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Download the files**: Download the project files and place them in a folder named `sporty-store`.
2. **Open `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the homepage. 
3. **Edit the Content**: If you want to customize the text, images, or links:
    - Open `index.html`, `about.html`, or `sale.html` and modify the content between the `<body>` tags.
    - Change the product images, names, and prices in the `products` section.
4. **Change the Banner**: To update the banner, replace the `banner.jpg` with a custom image (1200px x 300px) and ensure it is saved in the same directory.
    - Update the `style.css` if you want to adjust the bannerâ€™s appearance.
5. **Customize the Forms**: 
    - The contact and feedback forms are simple HTML forms. To process form submissions, integrate them with a backend (e.g., PHP, Node.js) or a third-party service (e.g., Google Forms, Formspree).

## Deployment

### Using GitHub Pages (for static sites)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the `sporty-store` folder to it.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and choose the `main` branch to deploy from.

### Using Netlify (for easier deployment)
1. Create an account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Click **New Site from Git** and choose your repository.
3. Netlify will automatically deploy your site, and you'll get a live URL.
